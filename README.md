### Technical Requirements
- A GPU Instnace to run the Keras training model.
- This model was made with AWS's p2.xlarge EC2 Instance

## Description
This the capstone project for the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree.

In this project, I created a machine learning model that can translate a Japanese sentences to English. Translating between Japanese and English is notoriously difficult due to the vast linguistic differences in the structure, grammar, and vocabulary of the languages. Languages with similar roots or linguistic history are often easier to translate to each other both by humans and machines. However, dissimilar languages often have an added challenge. This project is inspired by this article where an RNN model was built to translate English to French [Language Translation with RNN](https://towardsdatascience.com/language-translation-with-rnns-d84d43b40571). The dataset for this project will utilize the corpus provided by [Yusuke Oda](https://github.com/odashi/small_parallel_enja).
