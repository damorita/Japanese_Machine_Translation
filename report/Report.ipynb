    "### Project Overview\n",
    "Deep Learning technology has exponentially expanded the possibilities of machine learning capabilities in recent years. One of the most popular applications of which is in natural language processing and language translation due to the the technology's ability to process the more complicated structure that is human language. Thanks to advancements in this field, in 2016, Google announced that it's popular Google Translate services will transition to artificial neural network based algorithms as the foundation of its translation software. Among the various deep neural network architectures, the Recurrent Nueral Network is structure is commonly used for NLP tasks due to the temporal & sequential structure of languages. [Google’s Neural Machine Translation System: Bridging the Gap between Human and Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.08144.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I created a machine learning model that can translate a Japanese sentences to English. Translating between Japanese and English is notoriously difficult due to the vast linguistic differences in the structure, grammar, and vocabulary of the languages. Languages with similar roots or linguistic history are often easier to translate to each other both by humans and machines. However, dissimilar languages often have an added challenge. This project is inspired by this article where an RNN model was built to translate English to French [Language Translation with RNN](https://towardsdatascience.com/language-translation-with-rnns-d84d43b40571). The dataset for this project will utilize the corpus provided by [Yusuke Oda](https://github.com/odashi/small_parallel_enja).\n",

    "\n",
    "The objective of this project is to build a model, learned using data samples of Japanese sentences with their English translations, that will automatically return the translated English sentence when a new Japanese sentences has been passed to it. \n",
    "The tasks will take the following steps:\n",
    "1. Import the Japanese and English sentence datasets\n",
    "2. Preprocess the dataset into tokens, numerical representations and padded vectors.\n",
    "3. Train a RNN model over the preprocessed training data set\n",

    "\n",
    "### Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "The basis of the evaluation will be to compare the English sentence the model produces, against the appropriate label sentence which the model was intended to produce. Since translation can be a very difficult concept to score with multiple methods to evaluate, there are numerous options to be selected here. The proposed evaluation metric is to utilize the [Word Error Rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_error_rate) to evaluate a score between the the model output and target sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Word Error rate calculation is as follows:\n",
    "WER = (S+D+I) / N  = (S+D+I) / (S+D+C)\n",
    "\n",
    "Where S is the number of substitutions, D is the number of deletions, I is the number of insertions, C is the number of correct words, and N is the number of words in the reference (N=S+D+C).  This methodology provides a simple yet effective method to determine how closely a sentece resembles another. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to take note that one shortfall of this method is that the semantics of the original sentence is not taken into considerations. Although word selection may closely resemble the target sentence, words out of order or small differences in diction can vastly alter the intended meaning of the original sentence. \n",

Yuseke Oda has taken the Tanaka Corpus and preprocessed the data for easier consumption for machine translation models. The corpus training dataset contains 50,000 Japanese - English sentence pairs, and the validation dataset is 500 sentence pairs.  All of sentences are pretokenized using Stanford Tokenizer and KyTea, with each sentence between 4~16 words in length. The sentences provided in the Oda corpus do not share a common topic or theme and vary in vocabulary. All of the English sentences are contained in files ending with a '.en' while all the Japanese sentences are in files ending with '.ja'. Each translation pair occupies the the same line position in it's complimentary file. For example, the English translation to the first line in train.ja is the first line in train.en.\n",
